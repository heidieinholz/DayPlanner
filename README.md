Homework 5 - Third Party API - Day Planner

## Instructions
To better organize your workday, utilize an interactive Day Planner that stores your assignments in local storage, allowing you to retrieve your plans even after refreshing your page.

To keep on top of the progress of the day, the assignments are color-coded.  Grey indicates the past, red indicates the present hour, and green indicates future hours.

This planner utilizes jQuery, HTML, and CSS.
